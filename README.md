# Covid_19-TestCenter-App

Covid-19 TestCenter Application was our school project based on Java using Spring Framework with Spring Boot. Basically, we used Spring Boot with Thymeleaf template and MySQL database for storage purposes as backend.

It is mainly Java, and a bit of CSS, HTML, Bootstrap and JavaScript with our view layer being Thymeleaf.

The project have three web options: TestCenter, VaccineCenter and InfectionCenter. Bear in mind, we just added the last two options but the testCenter is the main app.
There are three user roles: user, secreatary and admin.

The customer (aka patient user) should be able to login (basic login - already user can log in & new user can register first before logging in) check its information about the three option whether they have an appointment (or make it), assigned time for vaccination or any info about infections. In short, patient user has read-only permission.
However, Secretary has update & read permission whereas Admin has the full #CRUD# operations. That way only the Admin can delete anything in our app.

Please do check out our Covid-19 TestCenter Web App and setup the database to your specific needs.

Thank you in advance.
